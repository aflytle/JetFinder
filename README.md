fj_pythia_test.C: a complete loop up to two events, using methods listed in the virtual environment file.<br />
JetHistFileOpener.C: Reads (and opens objects inside of) TFile produced by fj_pythia_test (both objects are histograms, one for the transverse momentum by particle, and the other by jet) <br />
